In the notes of the VM, make sure you set the Environment to the following: GTIntune, 2PIntune, or CMLAB
This was to allow to run different labs on different days of the week, keeping clients active enough to be useful, creating data, and allowing for a host to host more than one lab.

Each lab gets to run 2 days a week, but the host gets Sunday off to rest, as any good Christian host should try. :-)
