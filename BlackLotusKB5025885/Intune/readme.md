# KB5025885  - Black Lotus for Intune

## Intune Remediation Script Setup

### Monitor Only - PreCheck-BlackLotusStatusMonitor Script
I've created this for you to get a highlevel overview of your devices and their situation without making any changes.  It will let you know if the device has any prereq issues (Secure Boot Disabled, or too old of OS), along with the current stage / step of the Remediation process it is currently on.
