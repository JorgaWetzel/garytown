# 2Pint iPXE / 2PXE Docs

I plan to build some quick starts for the iPXE solutions, they will be placed here as I get time.  I'm starting with the standalone, because that's what I'm testing at work right now, but will get back to showing how to setup the iPXE with ConfigMgr integration, which is how I have always used it until today.

These are NOT official docs, those are on the website, but I wanted a place to start creating my own drafts which will probably, maybe, get to the official GitHub as documentation.

I hope to go much deeper here too, getting into advanced topics for iPXE and using PowerShell to do really cool things with booting devices.  

Long Term goal is to create videos too.

If you got questions and requests, feel free to connect with me on WinAdmins Discord (@gwblok) and I'll try to help or get you connected with the proper support channel.
