Simple OSDCloud Setup Script for AMD64 (x64) WinPE

IT IS MEANT TO BE RUN SECTION BY SECTION, so you can see what it is doing.

This script will assist in setting up OSDCloud from scratch, including creating a new template, workspace, and USB drive.
It will name the template & workspace based on the ADK WinPE version installed on the system.

#Make Sure you're running Latest
Update-Module -name OSD -Force

#Restart PowerShell after OSD has been updated (if it needed to be updated)

#ADK Default Locations
$ADKAMD64WinPELocation = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\en-us\winpe.wim"
$ADKAMD64WinPEVersion = (Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath $ADKAMD64WinPELocation -Index 1).Version.replace('10.0.','')

#Create the Template Name & Display Name in Console 
$TemplateName = "OSDCloudWinPE-$($ADKAMD64WinPEVersion)"
Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green "OSDCloud Template Name Set to: $TemplateName"

#Setup WorkSpace Location
Import-Module -name OSD -force
$OSDCloudWorkspace = "C:\OSDCloudWinPE-$($ADKAMD64WinPEVersion)"
[void][System.IO.Directory]::CreateDirectory($OSDCloudWorkspace)
if (Test-Path -Path $OSDCloudWorkspace){
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green "Workspace Location Created: $OSDCloudWorkspace"
}

#New Template, this will create a new template based on the ADK WinPE version installed on the system
#This takes awhile, so be patient. It will take the winpe.wim from the ADK, apply all of the optional components
#It also will add 7Zip into the WinPE image, long with several other components uses by OSDCloud.
New-OSDCloudTemplate -Name $TemplateName -Add7Zip


#New WorkSpace
#This will create a new workspace based on the template created above.  This is very quick because it's just copying the template to the workspace location.
#Once it does the copy, you can make your edits to the workspace, most of which are done with Edit-OSDCloudWinPE.
New-OSDCloudWorkspace -WorkspacePath $OSDCloudWorkspace
#Create the Setup Complete Templates that you can modify to have OSDCloud kick off your own custom script during Setup Complete.
New-OSDCloudWorkSpaceSetupCompleteTemplate

#Added HPCMSL into WinPE, USB Ethernet Drivers & HP WinPE DriverPack
Edit-OSDCloudWinPE -PSModuleInstall HPCMSL -CloudDriver USB, HP
#After you run this, if you're going to use this for PXE or ISE, you do not need to create the USB drive.
#Instead of creating the USB drive, you can create a new ISO file that you can use for PXE or ISE.
New-OSDCloudISO -WorkspacePath $OSDCloudWorkspace
#You can now use that ISO to boot VM's or grab the contents for PXE.


#Create Cloud USB, which will be based on the workspace created above.
#This takes a little awhile and does the basic setup of the USB drive, including copying the WinPE image to the USB drive.
New-OSDCloudUSB

#Update the Cloud USB drive
#Note, I found I need to add some parameters for it to sync over everything properly.
Update-OSDCloudUSB -OSName 'Windows 11 24H2' -OSActivation Retail

#At this point, you should have a completely working OSDCloud USB Drive.
